A self sizing `UITableViewCell` with two labels that support Dynamic Type.

import UIKit

/*
 This file is the core of this sample. It contains a custom `UITableViewCell` subclass with two labels that support Dynamic Type.
 In `CustomCell.setUpLabelsAndConstraints()`, you can see how the labels and constraints are set up so that both fonts and spacings
 are automatically adjusted when the device's content size changes.
 
 To see this in effect:
 1. Run this sample in the Simulator
 2. Open the Accessibility Inspector (Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Accessibility Inspector) and connect to the Simulator
 3. In the Settings, adjust the Font size.
